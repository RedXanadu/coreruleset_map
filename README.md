A map of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set

The original Graphviz DOT files are available, as well as spiced-up SVG and PDF files.

If working with the DOT files, use the label line wrapping script to format the labels nicely (Graphviz itself doesn't support line wrapping, so this needs to be handled separately):

```bash
./label_line_wrap.sh crs_3-3-2.dot
```
